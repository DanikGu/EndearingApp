## Endearing App

Application that was inspired by Power Apps and Creatio, where you can create a database structure and user interface with low effort.
# What can you do in the app right now

    You can create a database structure in the Data Customization tab.
    Then, you can interact with the OData API in the OData Explorer tab.

For now, the OData API supports all CRUD operations on tables created in the Data Customization tab, supports all querying operations from the OData specifications, and also supports batch requests.
